## Run speedlogger as a service
To run it as a service, we are firstly going to create a file in the /etc/init.d/ folder to have our own service. Letâ€™s create a speedLogger file:
```bash
$ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/speedLogger.service
```
And put the following content:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=SpeedLogger Service

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node <path_to_this_repo>/index.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
Environment=PORT=3001
WorkingDirectory=<path_to_this_repo>            
```
set permissions and enable the service we've just created:
```bash
$ sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/speedLogger.service 
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable speedLogger.service
```
To start the server, simply type:
```bash
$sudo systemctl start speedLogger.service
```
